# GizmoOS
GizmoOS is my personal Operating System, being built with COSMOS. I will upload the project when I finish the FAT filesystem because then I think it will be presentable. The Password is 1234, but the code can be changed for a different one. See "What it does right now" for details.

***Note that I am kind of an amateur with this stuff, so this may stay barebones until I get the ropes of it. I am, however, always developing it. I would always take some help :). Please file an issue under "issues" if you find something wrong with the project, or have a suggestion***

# What it does right now?
So far, it has commands, for basic interaction, and it has a password (though I need to make it be able to set a password on its first boot). It also has MIV Text Editor.

# What did I use?
I used Cosmos OS Userkit, which uses Visual Basic Studio and C# to create the kernel and OS.

# Can I clone this?
Yes, you can. But I suggest that you get someone else's for now because mine is pretty barebone.

# Plans:
- FAT Filesystem
- Clock
- GUI

# Far future plans:
- Networking
- Multi-threading
- Snake Game
